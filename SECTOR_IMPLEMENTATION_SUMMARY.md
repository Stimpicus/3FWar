# Sector-Based Mission Cost Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds a sector-based mission cost system that divides the hex grid into three native territories, one for each playable faction (Orange, Green, Blue). Each hex is assigned to a sector based on its axial coordinates, and mission costs are adjusted based on whether a faction is operating in its native sector or in enemy territory.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core System Files

#### `hex_grid.py`
- Added `native_sector` field to `HexCell` class to store sector ownership ('orange', 'green', or 'blue')
- Added `sector_axes` dictionary to `HexGrid.__init__()` defining the three sector axis endpoints
- Implemented `_determine_native_sector()` method to calculate which sector a hex belongs to based on axial coordinates
  - Orange sector: hexes where `abs(q)` is smallest (extends along q ≈ 0)
  - Green sector: hexes where `abs(s)` is smallest (extends along s = -q - r ≈ 0)
  - Blue sector: hexes where `abs(r)` is smallest (extends along r ≈ 0)
- Added `get_faction_home_base()` method to return the central home base hex for each faction
  - Orange: (0, -4)
  - Green: (-4, 4)
  - Blue: (4, 0)
- Updated `_initialize_grid()` to assign native sectors to all cells during initialization
- Updated `expand_grid()` to assign native sectors to newly created cells
- Added `distance_to()` method to `Hex` class for calculating distance between any two hexes

#### `faction.py`
- Completely rewrote `_calculate_mission_cost()` method to include sector-based modifiers:
  - **Base cost calculation**: Unchanged, based on mission type and distance from center
  - **Cross-sector multiplier**: 1.5x when operating outside native territory
  - **Proximity multiplier**: Up to 3.0x additional penalty when near enemy home base
    - Decreases linearly with distance
    - Threshold: 12 hexes (beyond this, no proximity penalty)
  - **Final formula**: `cost = base_cost * cross_sector_multiplier * proximity_multiplier`

### 2. Documentation

#### `SECTOR_SYSTEM.md`
Complete documentation covering:
- Sector definitions and axes
- Mission cost calculation formulas
- Example costs and multipliers
- Balancing parameters and their valid ranges
- Design goals and implementation details
- Testing instructions

### 3. Tests and Demonstrations

#### `test_sector_system.py`
Comprehensive test suite validating:
- Sector assignments for all factions
- Faction home base positions
- Mission costs in same sector
- Mission costs in cross-sector (near and far from base)
- Disrupt mission costs
- Cost multiplier scaling with distance

#### `test_sector_visualization.py`
Visualization tool showing:
- Sector assignments along each axis
- Distribution of hexes across sectors
- Home base sector alignment

#### `demo_sector_costs.py`
Interactive demonstration showing:
- Cost comparisons for various scenarios
- Visual breakdown of multipliers
- Key insights about the system

## Key Features

### 1. Three Native Sectors
- Each hex is assigned to one of three sectors based on its position
- Sectors are roughly equal in size (~30-35% of grid each)
- Assignment is deterministic based on axial coordinates

### 2. Economic Incentives (No Hard Restrictions)
- Factions can operate anywhere on the map
- Cross-sector operations are more expensive, not prohibited
- Natural economic pressure guides factions to their native territories

### 3. Proximity Penalties
- Missions near enemy home bases are much more expensive
- Penalty decreases linearly with distance
- Makes disruption near bases viable but costly

### 4. Scalable Costs
- Disrupt missions (base: 5,000 credits) become very expensive in cross-sector
- Example: Disrupting at enemy base costs ~27,000 credits vs ~6,250 in own sector
- Economic discouragement from permanent cross-sector expansion

### 5. Tunable Parameters
All multipliers are configurable for balance adjustments:
- `BASE_CROSS_SECTOR_MULTIPLIER = 1.5` (range: 1.0-2.0)
- `MAX_PROXIMITY_MULTIPLIER = 3.0` (range: 1.0-5.0)
- `PROXIMITY_DISTANCE_THRESHOLD = 12` (range: 6-20)

## Test Results

### All Existing Tests Pass
- ✓ `test_coordinate_mapping.py` - Grid initialization correct
- ✓ `test_contiguity.py` - Contiguity constraints enforced
- ✓ `test_game_balance.py` - Balance changes working
- ✓ `test_comprehensive.py` - Long-term stability verified
- ✓ `test_sim.py` - Simulation runs correctly
- ✓ `test_disrupt_reclaim.py` - Mission constraints enforced

### New Tests Pass

- ✓ `demo_sector_costs.py` - Demonstration runs successfully

## Example Cost Comparison

| Scenario | Own Sector | Cross-Sector (Far) | Cross-Sector (Near Base) |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Claim mission | 1,250 | 1,875 | 5,000-5,400 |
| Disrupt mission | 6,250 | 7,000 | 25,000-27,000 |
| Multiplier | 1.0x | 1.5x | 4.0-4.3x |

## Benefits

1. **Balanced Gameplay**: Each faction has equal native territory
2. **Strategic Depth**: Players must weigh cost vs benefit for expansion
3. **Natural Boundaries**: Economic forces create soft borders between territories
4. **Tactical Flexibility**: Disruption remains viable for strategic strikes
5. **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
6. **Fully Tested**: Comprehensive test suite validates all aspects
