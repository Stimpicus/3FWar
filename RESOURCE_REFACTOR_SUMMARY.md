# Resource System Refactor - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Grid Initialization Updates (hex_grid.py)

**Before:**
- 108 total hexes (61 owned + 47 unclaimed)
- 26 unclaimed hexes were NOT adjacent to owned territories

**After:**
- 91 total hexes (61 owned + 30 unclaimed)
- ALL 30 unclaimed hexes are directly adjacent to owned territories
- Each faction (grey, orange, blue, green) has adjacent unclaimed hexes for expansion

**Implementation:**
```python
# Updated yellow_coords to only include hexes adjacent to owned territories
yellow_coords = [
    (-5, 0), (-5, 1), (-5, 2), (-5, 3), (-5, 4), (-5, 5), (-4, -1), (-4, 5),
    (-3, -2), (-3, 5), (-2, -3), (-2, 5), (-1, -4), (-1, 5), (0, -5), (0, 5),
    (1, -5), (1, 4), (2, -5), (2, 3), (3, -5), (3, 2), (4, -5), (4, 1),
    (5, -5), (5, -4), (5, -3), (5, -2), (5, -1), (5, 0),
]
```

### 2. Resource System Refactor

#### Faction Class (faction.py)

**Removed Fields:**
- `total_resources` - No longer tracked separately
- `net_worth` - No longer calculated

**Updated Fields:**
- `credits` - Now the sole resource metric
- `daily_production` - Still tracked for display

**Updated Methods:**
- `add_credits()` - Simplified, no longer updates net_worth
- `spend_credits()` - Simplified, no longer updates net_worth
- `weekly_reset()` - Simplified, only resets credits to 10,000
- Removed `add_resources()` method entirely

#### Simulation Class (simulation.py)

**Daily Processing (_process_daily):**
- Changed from: `faction.add_resources(total_deposited)`
- Changed to: `faction.add_credits(total_deposited)`
- Daily income from territories now adds directly to credits

**Reset Method:**
- Removed initialization of `total_resources` and `net_worth`
- Only resets `credits` and `daily_production`

**State Management:**
- `get_state()`: Removed `total_resources` and `net_worth` from output
- `save_state()`: Removed `total_resources` and `net_worth` from saved data
- `load_state()`: Ignores old `total_resources` and `net_worth` fields for backwards compatibility

### 3. UI Updates (main.py)

**UIPanel.draw() Changes:**
- Removed "Net Worth" display line
- Updated display order to show:
  1. Credits
  2. Daily Production
  3. Territory Count

### 4. Test Updates

**Updated Files:**
- `test_sim.py` - Removed net_worth and total_resources assertions
- `test_comprehensive.py` - Updated to use credits instead of net_worth for rankings
- `test_game_balance.py` - Removed total_resources assertion from reset test

**New Test File:**
- `test_resource_refactor.py` - Comprehensive test suite for the refactored system

## Verification

All tests pass:
- ✓ test_sim.py
- ✓ test_resource_refactor.py
- ✓ test_game_balance.py
- ✓ test_comprehensive.py
- ✓ Main application starts successfully

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Resource System**: Credits are now the single source of truth for faction resources
2. **Cleaner Grid**: Only relevant unclaimed hexes are included at startup
3. **Better Expansion**: All factions have equal opportunity to expand with adjacent unclaimed hexes
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Load system can handle old save files with total_resources/net_worth fields

## Visual Changes

Screenshots captured showing the updated UI:
- `ui_changes_screenshot.png` - UI panel with new display format
- `full_ui_screenshot.png` - Full application view with hex grid and UI

The UI now clearly shows:
- Credits (the sole resource metric)
- Daily Production
- Territory Count

...without the confusion of separate "Net Worth" and "Resources" fields.
