# Implementation Summary: Spiral Ordering, Adjacency Constraints, and Visual Indicators

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the three main requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Initial Hex Grid & Ownership (Spiral Order)

**Modified Files:**
- `hex_grid.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `is_permanent` flag to `HexCell` class to mark permanently owned territories
- Created `_generate_spiral_order()` method that generates hexes in a downward clockwise spiral from center (0,0)
- Updated `_initialize_grid()` to use spiral ordering with IDs 0-60
- Mapped ownership according to specification:
  - **Grey** (22 hexes): IDs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 21, 27, 33, 39, 40, 41, 47, 48, 49, 55, 56, 57
  - **Green** (13 hexes): IDs 9, 10, 11, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46
  - **Orange** (13 hexes): IDs 13, 14, 15, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54
  - **Blue** (13 hexes): IDs 7, 17, 18, 19, 20, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 58, 59, 60
- All 61 permanently owned territories are marked with `is_permanent=True` and `is_home=True`

**Key Features:**
- Permanent territories cannot be claimed, disrupted, or reclaimed by other factions
- Spiral order ensures consistent layout matching the original design
- `reset()` method updated to preserve permanent territories

### 2. Claim Mission Logic (Adjacency Constraint)

**Modified Files:**
- `faction.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `_find_claim_targets()` to use a `seen` set to avoid duplicate targets
- Modified to only return unclaimed hexes (owner is None) adjacent to owned/claimed territory
- Enhanced `execute_mission()` to check `is_permanent` flag:
  - Claim missions: Only succeed on unclaimed, non-permanent territories
  - Disrupt/Reclaim missions: Cannot target permanent territories

**Key Features:**
- Factions can only offer Claim missions for unclaimed territories directly adjacent to territories they own
- Adjacency constraint enforced in both AI evaluation and mission execution
- Permanent territories are completely immune to all mission types from other factions

### 3. Visual Indicators

**Modified Files:**
- `main.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `HexRenderer.draw_hex()` signature to accept `is_permanent` and `is_protected` flags
- Added `draw_lock_icon()` method to render lock icon for permanent territories
- Added `draw_shield_icon()` method to render shield icon for protected territories
- Updated `Application.render()` to pass icon flags based on cell state

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Lock Icon**: Displayed on all permanently owned territories (61 hexes)
  - Simple black lock with white outline
  - Shackle arc and keyhole detail
  - Scaled to 40% of hex size
- **Shield Icon**: Displayed on all protected territories
  - Blue shield with white outline
  - Cross detail in center
  - Scaled to 40% of hex size

### 4. State Persistence

**Modified Files:**
- `simulation.py`

**Changes:**
- Updated `save_state()` to include `is_permanent` flag in serialization
- Updated `load_state()` to restore `is_permanent` flag (with backwards compatibility)

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:

### `test_requirements.py`
- Verifies all 61 permanently owned territories are correctly assigned
- Validates spiral order matches specification
- Confirms ownership counts (Grey: 22, Green: 13, Orange: 13, Blue: 13)
- Tests that permanent territories cannot be claimed
- Validates claim adjacency constraint
- Confirms visual indicators are implemented

### `test_disrupt_reclaim.py`
- Tests that permanent territories cannot be disrupted
- Tests that permanent territories cannot be reclaimed
- Validates protection system works correctly
- Confirms non-permanent territories can be disrupted after protection expires

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python test_requirements.py
python test_disrupt_reclaim.py
python test_sim.py

# Run simulation
python main.py
```

## Results

All requirements have been successfully implemented and tested:

✅ **Initial Hex Grid & Ownership**
- 61 hexes assigned in spiral order (IDs 0-60)
- Ownership matches specification exactly
- Permanent territories are protected from all mission types

✅ **Claim Mission Logic**
- Factions only offer Claim missions for adjacent unclaimed territories
- Adjacency constraint enforced in AI and execution
- Cannot claim permanent territories

✅ **Visual Indicators**
- Lock icons displayed on all 61 permanent territories
- Shield icons displayed on all protected territories
- Icons are clearly visible and appropriately scaled
- See `full_app_screenshot.png` for demonstration

## Screenshots

- `visual_indicators_test.png` - Close-up view showing lock and shield icons
- `full_app_screenshot.png` - Full application view with UI panel and visual indicators

## Backwards Compatibility

All changes are backwards compatible:
- Existing save files will load correctly (is_permanent defaults to False)
- Existing tests continue to pass
- No breaking changes to public APIs
