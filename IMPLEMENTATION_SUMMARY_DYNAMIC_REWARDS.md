# Implementation Summary: Dynamic Mission Reward System

## Problem Statement Requirements

1. ✅ Remove starting and guaranteed weekly income for all factions
2. ✅ Change mercenary mission system from costing factions to rewarding mercenaries
3. ✅ Implement dynamic reward calculations based on territory balance
4. ✅ Refactor Faction, FactionAI, Simulation, and UI logic

## Implementation Details

### 1. Removed Faction Income

**Changes to `faction.py`:**
- `Faction.__init__()`: Changed initial credits from 10,000 to 0
- `Faction.weekly_reset()`: Removed credit reset (now empty method)

**Changes to `simulation.py`:**
- `Simulation.reset()`: Set initial credits to 0
- `Simulation._process_weekly()`: Updated comment, no longer resets credits

**Result:** Factions now only earn credits through daily resource production from territories.

### 2. Mission Cost → Mission Reward

**Changes to `faction.py`:**
- `Mission` class: Changed `cost` parameter to `reward`
- `FactionAI.evaluate_missions()`: Updated to calculate rewards instead of costs
- `FactionAI.execute_mission()`: 
  - Removed credit affordability check
  - Removed credit deduction
  - Removed refund logic
  - Simplified to 1 mercenary per mission

**Before:**
```python
if not self.faction.spend_credits(mission.cost):
    return False
required_mercs = max(1, mission.cost // 10000)
if not self.mercenary_pool.allocate(required_mercs, current_hour):
    self.faction.add_credits(mission.cost)  # Refund
    return False
```

**After:**
```python
required_mercs = 1  # Each mission requires 1 mercenary
if not self.mercenary_pool.allocate(required_mercs, current_hour):
    return False
# Mission rewards are not deducted from faction credits
```

### 3. Dynamic Reward Calculation

**New method in `faction.py`:**
- `FactionAI._calculate_mission_reward()`: Replaced `_calculate_mission_cost()`

**Helper methods added:**
- `_get_territory_counts()`: Returns dict of territory counts for all factions
- `_get_faction_with_most_territories()`: Returns faction and count
- `_get_faction_with_least_territories()`: Returns faction and count

**Reward Formulas:**

**Claim Missions:**
- Base reward: 1,000 credits
- Underdog multiplier: `1 + (most/least - 1) * 0.5`, capped at 3.0x
- Leader multiplier: `least/most`, minimum 0.3x

**Disrupt Missions:**
- Base reward: 5,000 credits
- Targeting underdog: multiplier `least/most`, minimum 0.3x
- Targeting leader: multiplier `1 + (most/least - 1) * 0.5`, capped at 3.0x

**Reclaim Missions:**
- Base reward: 3,000 credits
- Same scaling as claim missions (benefits executing faction)

### 4. Example Scenarios

**Scenario: Blue leads with 315 territories, Orange struggles with 19**

| Mission Type | Executor | Target | Base Reward | Actual Reward | Multiplier |
|--------------|----------|--------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| Claim | Blue (leader) | - | 1,000 | 300 | 0.3x (penalty) |
| Claim | Orange (underdog) | - | 1,000 | ~3,000 | 3.0x (bonus) |
| Disrupt | Any | Blue (leader) | 5,000 | 15,000 | 3.0x (bonus) |
| Disrupt | Any | Orange (underdog) | 5,000 | 1,500 | 0.3x (penalty) |

## Testing

### New Tests Created

**`test_dynamic_rewards.py`:**
1. ✅ No initial credits (0 vs 10,000)
2. ✅ No weekly credit reset
3. ✅ Missions use reward field not cost
4. ✅ Dynamic rewards for underdog
5. ✅ Missions don't deduct faction credits
6. ✅ Reset sets credits to 0
7. ✅ Reward scaling with territory imbalance

**`demo_dynamic_rewards.py`:**
- Interactive demonstration of reward scaling
- Shows comparison with old system
- Explains mechanics clearly

### Updated Tests

**Modified files:**
- `test_game_balance.py`: Updated credit assertions (10,000 → 0)
- `test_comprehensive.py`: Updated credit assertions (10,000 → 0)
- `test_sector_system.py`: Marked as deprecated, updated method calls
- `demo_sector_costs.py`: Updated terminology (cost → reward)

### Test Results

All tests passing:
```
✅ test_dynamic_rewards.py - All 7 tests passed
✅ test_game_balance.py - All 7 tests passed  
✅ test_comprehensive.py - All 10 tests passed
✅ test_sim.py - Simulation runs correctly
```

## Documentation

**New documentation files:**
- `DYNAMIC_REWARD_SYSTEM.md`: Complete technical documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_DYNAMIC_REWARDS.md`: This file
- `demo_dynamic_rewards.py`: Interactive demonstration

## Impact on Gameplay

### Economic Changes
- **No Safety Net**: Factions can't recover from losses through guaranteed income
- **Territory-Driven**: All credits come from resource production
- **Self-Balancing**: Rewards automatically adjust to maintain competition

### Strategic Changes
- **Underdog Advantage**: Smaller factions get better mission rewards
- **Anti-Snowball**: Leading factions face reduced rewards
- **Leader Targeting**: Disrupting the leader is more rewarding
- **Underdog Protection**: Attacking the weakest faction is less rewarding

### Balance Improvements
- Prevents runaway victories
- Encourages competitive gameplay
- Creates comeback mechanics
- Shifts focus from economic management to territorial strategy

## Files Changed Summary

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `faction.py` | Mission.cost→reward, new reward calculation, territory helpers, removed credit checks |
| `simulation.py` | Initial credits 0, no weekly reset |
| `test_game_balance.py` | Updated credit assertions |
| `test_comprehensive.py` | Updated credit assertions |
| `test_sector_system.py` | Deprecated, updated method names |
| `demo_sector_costs.py` | Updated terminology |

**New files:**
- `test_dynamic_rewards.py`
- `DYNAMIC_REWARD_SYSTEM.md`
- `demo_dynamic_rewards.py`

## Verification

All problem statement requirements have been successfully implemented:

✅ **Requirement 1**: Removed starting and weekly income  
✅ **Requirement 2**: Changed missions to reward mercenaries, not cost factions  
✅ **Requirement 3**: Dynamic rewards based on territory balance  
✅ **Requirement 4**: Refactored Faction, FactionAI, Simulation logic  

The system is fully functional, tested, and documented.
