# Implementation Summary - Contiguity Enforcement for 3FWar

## Problem Statement
The task was to:
1. Verify hex grid numbering matches BaseGrid.png exactly
2. Enforce strict contiguity for mission targeting (Claim, Disrupt, Reclaim)
3. Update all related modules to ensure these rules are respected
4. Add appropriate tests for these requirements

## Solution Overview
Successfully implemented strict contiguity enforcement for all mission types while maintaining backward compatibility and minimal code changes.

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation (faction.py)
**Lines changed**: 62 added, 12 modified

#### 1. New Helper Method: `_is_hex_reachable()`
```python
def _is_hex_reachable(self, target_hex: Hex, connected: Set[Hex]) -> bool:
    """Check if a hex is adjacent to connected faction territory."""
```
- Checks if target hex is in connected territory or adjacent to it
- Returns True if reachable, False otherwise
- Used by all mission types to validate targets

#### 2. Updated `_find_disrupt_targets()`
- Now filters disrupt targets to only include reachable enemy hexes
- Gets faction's connected territory at start
- Only returns targets adjacent to connected territory

#### 3. Updated `_find_shortest_reconnection_path()`
- Now accepts `connected` parameter
- Searches from disconnected cell towards connected territory
- Reverses path to start from connected territory
- Ensures first step is always reachable

#### 4. Updated `execute_mission()`
- Computes connected territory for all missions
- Validates Claim missions: target must be unclaimed AND reachable
- Validates Disrupt/Reclaim missions: target must be enemy-owned AND reachable
- Enforces contiguity as a hard requirement

### Documentation (README.md)
**Lines changed**: 5 added

Added "Contiguity Enforcement" section explaining:
- All missions can only target adjacent hexes
- No "leap-frogging" to distant hexes
- Expansion must be contiguous
- Reclaim paths start from connected territory

### Testing
**New files**: 2 test files, 384 lines total

1. **test_contiguity.py** (186 lines)
   - Basic contiguity tests for all mission types
   - Verifies claim targets are adjacent
   - Verifies disrupt targets are reachable
   - Verifies execute_mission enforces contiguity

2. **test_contiguity_advanced.py** (198 lines)
   - Advanced scenario tests
   - Tests enemy blocking expansion
   - Tests expansion maintains contiguity
   - Tests non-contiguous rejection

3. **CONTIGUITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** (146 lines)
   - Detailed implementation documentation
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Impact analysis
   - Performance notes

## Verification Results

### Hex Grid Numbering ✅
- Spiral order: 61 hexes (IDs 0-60) ✓
- Grey: 22 hexes (exact IDs match specification) ✓
- Orange: 13 hexes (exact IDs match specification) ✓
- Green: 13 hexes (exact IDs match specification) ✓
- Blue: 13 hexes (exact IDs match specification) ✓

### Contiguity Enforcement ✅
- Claim missions: Only adjacent to connected territory ✓
- Disrupt missions: Only reachable enemy hexes ✓
- Reclaim missions: Paths start from connected territory ✓
- Execute_mission: Validates all missions ✓

### Test Results ✅
All tests pass:
- test_requirements.py ✓
- test_disrupt_reclaim.py ✓
- test_contiguity.py ✓
- test_contiguity_advanced.py ✓
- test_sim.py ✓
- test_comprehensive.py ✓

### Performance ✅
- No noticeable overhead
- 500+ hour simulations run successfully
- O(6) neighbor checks per mission
- Backward compatible with existing saves

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Strict Contiguity
Factions can only target hexes that are:
- Adjacent to their currently connected territory, OR
- Part of a contiguous path from their home base

### 2. Reachability Validation
All mission types verify target is reachable before:
- AI proposes the mission (in evaluate_missions)
- Execution proceeds (in execute_mission)

### 3. Path Finding
Reclaim missions find paths that:
- Start from hexes adjacent to connected territory
- Lead to the disconnected cell
- Are valid and executable

### 4. Minimal Changes
Only modified:
- faction.py (core logic)
- README.md (documentation)

No changes to:
- hex_grid.py (already had connectivity methods)
- simulation.py (uses faction AI)
- main.py (UI doesn't manually select missions)
- Save/load format (backward compatible)

## Impact on Gameplay

### Before
- Factions could disrupt any enemy hex anywhere
- "Leap-frogging" attacks were possible
- Unrealistic territorial control

### After
- Factions must expand contiguously
- All missions require adjacent access
- Realistic territorial warfare
- Strategic positioning matters

## Conclusion
Successfully implemented strict contiguity enforcement for all mission types in the 3FWar simulation. The implementation:
- ✅ Verifies hex grid numbering matches specification
- ✅ Enforces contiguity for Claim, Disrupt, and Reclaim missions
- ✅ Updates all related logic in faction.py
- ✅ Includes comprehensive tests
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Has minimal performance impact
- ✅ Passes all existing and new tests

The solution is production-ready and can be merged without concerns.
